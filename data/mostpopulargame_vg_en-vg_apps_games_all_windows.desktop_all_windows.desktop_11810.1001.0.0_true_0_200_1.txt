As you may know, most Spider Solitaire games are not winnable even though you play your best. That's where we come in. We included in this game only winnable deals for all types of games: with one suit, with 2 suits and 4 suits. Thus you can be sure that you will win if you play perfectly. Now you can truly enjoy the game. \r\nDownload and have fun playing Spider Solitaire Mobile!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Solvable deals that have at least one winning solution\r\n✓ 1 suit, 2 suits and 4 suits games\r\n✓ Advanced Hint option\r\n✓ Unlimited Undo\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop or Tap to move cards\r\n✓ Unmovable cards will be greyed out\r\n✓ Nice sound effects and music\r\n✓ Daily/monthly/all time highscores\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ HOW TO PLAY ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ The goal of the game is to create sets of cards that start with a king, queen and jack and end with an ace. Completed sets of cards will be automatically removed from the board and you score points. In order to win you have to remove all the cards from the board.\r\n✓ Drag-and-drop cards or simply tap on the cards to move them on an eligible column.\r\n✓ In games with more than one suit, in order for a set to be complete, all the cards in that column need to be in order and of the same suit. When you are successful in building a set, these will be automatically removed from the board. \r\n✓ You are allowed to mix different suits as long as the cards are in a descending order. But you cannot move the stacks, unless they're of the same suit.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place any card or any stack there.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves, tap on the stock pile at the bottom of the screen to be dealt a new row of cards.\r\n✓ You can only deal a new row of cards when all the columns are filled. Place at least one card on every column to be allowed to be dealt new rows of cards.\r\n✓ By default the set number of suits is 2. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change the number of suits from 2 to 4, from 4 to 1 and from 1 to 2. The changes take effect when you start a new game. \r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Enjoy hours of entertainment with our version with 3 games in one – traditional Backgammon, Narde and Fevga. \r\nBackgammon is one of the oldest board games known. It is a two player game where playing pieces are moved according to the roll of dice, and a player wins by removing all of their pieces from the board before their opponent. \r\n\r\nThe roll of the dice indicates how many points, the player is to move his checkers. The checkers are always moved forward. The following rules apply:\r\n- The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves. For example, if a player rolls 5 and 3, he may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another (or same) checker three spaces to an open point.\r\n- A player who rolls doubles plays the numbers shown on the dice twice. A roll of 6 and 6 means that the player has four sixes to use.\r\n- A player must use both (or all 4 for doubles) numbers of a roll if this is legally possible. When only one number can be played, the player must play that number. Or if either number can be played but not both, the player must play the larger one.\r\n- Once a player has moved all of his fifteen checkers into his home board, he may commence bearing off. A player bears off a checker by rolling a number that corresponds to the point on which the checker resides, and then removing that checker from the board. If there is no checker on the point indicated by the roll, you must make a legal move using a checker on a higher-numbered point. If there are no checkers on higher-numbered points, you must remove a checker from the highest point that has a checker.\r\n\r\nFevga First checker away\r\nYour first checker must pass the opponent's starting point before you may move any of your other checkers. \r\n\r\nBackGammon Hitting\r\nIf an opposing checker lands on a spot occupied by a single checker, this checker is placed on the bar. Any time a player has checkers on the bar, his first obligation is to enter those checker(s) into the opposing home board by moving it to an open point corresponding to one of the numbers on the rolled dice. \r\n\r\nNarde/Fevga Primes\r\nYou may not build a prime (six consecutive blocks) in front of all of the opponent's checkers; at least one opposing checker must be in front of your prime.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P4XS1Q2L9TW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Super Sonic Run","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25698.14579851951542234.6b0d658b-f32d-4087-a5ab-eaea97586e91.faadd1f8-b28c-469e-ab1c-4d62a1e8db74","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5664.14579851951542234.660fcd9b-bfcf-4dcc-aa01-45c641454310.3938c5d9-4b29-498e-b511-0ee01b5339f1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25698.14579851951542234.6b0d658b-f32d-4087-a5ab-eaea97586e91.faadd1f8-b28c-469e-ab1c-4d62a1e8db74","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2724RoyaleDragonPacoGames.SuperSonicRun_3jgwmpvqqqyxm"],"ContentIds":["005e838d-1792-e4d3-eafa-f69b6572d704"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Super Sonic Run is a journey of super mario style game!

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDD0CM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Unblock My Ambulance","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.37080.9007199266380026.ae9d6fc4-33cd-4d1f-8df0-e75cbd4aba1f.2712cb50-b3cf-44ef-bc79-ee6669867e2c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21157.9007199266380026.0a621b3c-7cbb-41e9-9c7d-d8a6f1dd627e.a62af239-e702-4136-ac5a-88f88a2bd04e","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.14875.9007199266380026.a179e09e-2313-461d-b046-5a130051579d.7ce0d0e9-c746-4091-9f7b-43b033085012","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19870.9007199266380026.60876e72-e432-42fc-8e6b-4b4a5fe44aa7.3333a02d-f08d-4834-b418-92e47a6153c2","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61808.9007199266380026.ea08443f-3e73-419f-9d89-8100bbcbf08c.2422e883-25a1-4aeb-b5c8-fdb38d198e8b","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24257.9007199266380026.497e8c74-c719-4bdc-9c4c-00c1839c0978.3556a5b8-46f2-4155-b161-fb4a9f12b58f","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45316.9007199266380026.70b814b4-5aae-469c-9a21-7d96c2ba0573.8cfe72e0-d219-4e71-9463-e3388a22f590","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38424.9007199266380026.87c5d127-a4e3-4a46-afdd-efa5012e4f0b.c3934b2b-3ada-49c6-adaf-8aa4af65f1a3","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59120.9007199266380026.f6fab6fa-69f1-467f-9746-2d77f74edd91.f5c3d6e1-b71c-4edc-addd-004b96936f7c","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.14618.9007199266380026.7e8415d3-7499-4d11-bdaf-4ca80c049f56.d72cafec-1938-46b6-9518-e9aa67f85974","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#760C0C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Kaufcom.UnblockMyAmbulance_0nzsbyvhcwntm"],"ContentIds":["3eda38b7-6db6-631e-f3d8-521619530022","a97ca49c-9358-b878-8449-24e59df5e9ab","8eef8785-94f6-04f2-c027-d154390a1c75"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Unblock My Ambulance is a challenging and addictive sliding block puzzle game.

With huge excitement, boys and girls decorate the Christmas tree, make sweets, deck out the house and look forward to their presents. These coloring pages depict your favorite Christmas characters and the main symbols of the festive season. The coloring process gives every kid the feeling of the Christmas holidays drawing near.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

The King's custom is to spend one night with a woman and execute her in the morning. To avoid this, Sharazad tells him tales of Ali Baba, Aladdin and Sinbad, but leaves part of it unfinished.The King, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins and only begins a new one, and the King, eager to hear the conclusion, postpones her execution once again until the King finally spares her life. So it goes on for 1,001 nights, The Arabian Nights.\r\n\r\nSOLDIER TURNED WORRIER:\r\nThis is your journey to the past. You are the worrier of the ‘Arabian Nights’.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play.
