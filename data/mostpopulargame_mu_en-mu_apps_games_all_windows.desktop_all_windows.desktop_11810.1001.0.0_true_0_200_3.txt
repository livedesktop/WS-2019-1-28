We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLQBB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Blitz Spil: Gratis Sjove Spil for To","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18844.9007199266424569.620d6620-eea2-4111-b667-acf720ffca56.49e7e0ab-0d56-4cd5-a0ef-76d9b793ea69","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7913.9007199266424569.2aba9069-5ccd-49bc-8fd5-d3598433e587.54920486-cb3e-4fb8-b51f-52c9a59ede2b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54800.9007199266424569.dbe9a8f6-d83a-4bef-8f28-82bf3397ab84.13a51cfb-1899-48ba-9a1a-61df24cb0e39","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Peaksel.MatchFast_tyntx30xb5zhp"],"ContentIds":["09fb3aa9-00b1-dbac-9dc6-2694fedf909a","c355b781-15a7-8d72-680e-16dc985e14e0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get a ticket for an awesome and exciting adventure of match mania.

numbers from 1 to 36 as well as the two zero slots, numbered 0 and 00.\r\n\r\nThe two zero slots are opposite each other on the wheel and consecutive numbers such as 1, 2 and 23, 24 also face each other. The two zeros are colored green and the rest of the numbers will alternate from red to black as we go round the wheel.\r\n\r\nAmerican Roulette Game Rules\r\n\r\n- American Roulette is a classic roulette game that features inside bets, outside bets, and favorite bets.\r\n- The roulette wheel has 38 slots numbered 0-36 with an additional 00. The object of the game is to predict which slot the ball will land in after the wheel is spun.\r\n- The minimum and maximum bets for the game are displayed on the MIN/MAX section of the table.\r\n- Payouts are made according to the Paytable. To view the Paytable, click the i-button in the keypad, alternatively see the Payout section below.\r\n\t\t\r\nHow to Play\r\n\r\nSelect a chip value, place your bets, spin the wheel, and wait to see if you have correctly predicted the winning number.\r\n\t\t\r\n- Selecting a chip value. To select the desired chip value, click a chip in the keypad area. If there are active arrows to the left and right of the chips, click these to see additional chip values.\r\n- You can point at different positions of the table to highlight the bets. When a bet position is highlighted, a window appears and displays the minimum and maximum bet limits for that bet.\r\n- Placing one or several bets. To place a bet, select the chip value and click either a number or a betting position on the table. Additional clicks add the required number of chips of the same value to the selected bet area.\r\n- After a bet is placed, you can point at the chips on the table to view the total value of the bet and the total payout if the bet wins.\r\n- Spinning the wheel. When you have finished betting, click the spin button to start a game round. The ball is then launched into the roulette wheel. The amount you bet is deducted from your account. The ball lands in a slot and the number on the slot is the winning number.\r\n- A player can stop the roulette wheel anytime while it is spinning, by clicking the spin button. This function is not available during Autoplay (not available in all casinos).\r\n- It is possible to spin the wheel without placing any bets (not available in all casinos).\r\n- Checking the winning number. When the ball lands in a slot, the winning number is announced and all winning bets are paid. The winning number is displayed on the roulette wheel. Your winnings are also displayed in the game panel and are added to your Cash amount. All losing bets are cleared from the table.\r\n- Playing again. Click the rebet button to place the same bet as in the previous round. Alternatively, click the clear all bets button to clear the table of all previous bets, place any new bets, and then click the spin button. For more information, refer to the Game Functions section below.\r\n\t\t\r\nAuto Adjust Bet\r\n\r\n- If a bet exceeds the bet limit or table limit, or if the player is out of money, the Auto Adjust Bet function automatically adjusts the bet to the highest possible amount. If the bet consists of several bet positions, it will be scaled down proportionally over the included bet positions. If the scaled down bet is too small to cover all desired bet positions, chips will be placed on as many of these positions as possible. If all desired bet positions cannot be covered, the game will randomly choose which positions should receive chips.\r\n- To activate this function, open the Game settings menu.\r\n\t\t\r\nFavourite Bets\r\n\r\n- The game has a favorite bets feature, which allows you to save bets of any configuration and place them automatically. To open the Favorite bets panel, click the Favorite bets button.\r\n- To save a bet as a favorite, place all your bets on the table and then open the Favorite bets panel. Click the + sign, enter a name for your bet.\r\n- You can save up to a maximum of 10 favorite bets.\r\n- To place one of your favorite bets, open the Favorite bets panel and select a bet from your list. All chips are placed automatically.\r\n- To delete a favorite bet, click the x button given next to the bet name in the favorite bets list.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N82DV4N7QR5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Snail Bob 1","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24979.14053553989066992.41c97172-5e74-4959-a67f-39c627c8cfef.b16d9c0f-ae30-41de-ba77-3fcd68c0bd26","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36663.14053553989066992.8773483d-87c1-4245-aae9-88d4b5d65a53.41f76e71-fbc4-4b7f-850b-131fbc23ffcc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24979.14053553989066992.41c97172-5e74-4959-a67f-39c627c8cfef.b16d9c0f-ae30-41de-ba77-3fcd68c0bd26","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["42508CraftingBuildingGame.SnailBob1_g5tmg5abxwb3j"],"ContentIds":["52f5ce0a-3890-0551-e6be-995ceb5639a8","128ed116-9465-196f-6646-26fcfc00c8d5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Snail Bob is on an epic adventure to find a new home.

It is said that Captain James Cook used to play a variant of Connect 4 with his fellow officers on his long voyages, and so this game has also been called \"Captain's Mistress\".\r\nConnect4 is named Force4, or Puissance4 in French, Forza4 in Italian, Conecta4 in Spanish, 4gewinnt in German, 4 op'n rij in Dutch, Fire på stribe in Danish, Neljän suora in Finnish, Czwórki in Polish, Четыре в ряд in Russian, 四子棋 in Chinese, and 四目並べ in Japanese...\r\n\r\nThe contemporary Connect4 game was launched by Milton Bradley at the beginning of the 70s. It consists of 7 columns, each 6 pieces high. This game is a neat conversion of a classic game where the aim is to connect four tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally, while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it is not! The \"vertical\" strategy you need to play Connect4 creates a unique challenge: you must think in a whole new way to block your opponent’s moves.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs any successful game, Connect 4 has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny \r\ndownload package, including powerful AI engine with 3 different difficult levels, ability to play against other person or the phone, undo and hints. \r\nUse menu (top right corner) to activate all those features","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM5Q1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku by blugri","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20153.9007199266445270.d5a07059-2564-462a-8969-8b89baa0be83.3ad98c75-8b3e-48fc-b26e-a376b48d6609","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53648.9007199266445270.24d34eef-7ea1-4670-a840-637336284f93.bfe3f4e1-f013-46eb-a43b-7f00dd79f1af","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["blugrisoftwareservicesBVB.Sudokubyblugri_phfv9b1xfqp1p"],"ContentIds":["077339c0-f0ab-470e-4952-d62759b86301"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The N°1 mobile Sudoku - unlimited generation of Sudoku’s and high quality graphics!\r\nChallenge your brain and play this classic puzzle game!

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    -
